    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome! I'm <strong>Zachary Nicholas</strong>, a multidisciplinary professional driven by practical problem-solving and innovation. My expertise spans mechanical troubleshooting, cybersecurity operations, and software development—skills honed through a rigorous journey in the military, academic projects, and continuous professional development.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Military Experience</h3>
    <p>
      During my time in the <strong>United States Marine Corps</strong>, I specialized in heavy equipment maintenance and diagnostics while tackling challenges across electrical, refrigeration, automotive support, and water systems. I managed technical publications and compliance, tracked inventory with GCSS-MC for effective logistics, and conducted thorough diagnostics on hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical systems. This hands-on experience laid the technical foundation for my evolving career.
    </p>

    <h3>College Projects</h3>
    <p>
      Transitioning from military operations to academia, I expanded into software development and cybersecurity. I designed and hosted a full-stack web application on AWS to demonstrate cloud deployment, developed automated security testing workflows using Python and Selenium for penetration testing, implemented secure coding practices aligned with NIST standards, and optimized both Linux and Windows operating systems for enhanced performance and security. I also built embedded system applications with Texas Instruments microcontrollers for real-time calibration.
    </p>

    <h3>Certifications & Professional Development</h3>
    <p>
      To further solidify my technical expertise, I earned industry-recognized credentials including CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and CySA+—validating my skills in hardware management, networking fundamentals, security best practices, and threat detection. In addition, I hold a cybersecurity certification from <strong>ISC2</strong>, reflecting my commitment to ongoing professional excellence.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Focus & Lifelong Learning</h3>
    <p>
      Today, I focus on security management, systems administration, and interdisciplinary problem-solving. My diverse background—bridging mechanical expertise, robust cybersecurity practices, and advanced software development—enables me to tackle technical challenges with precision, creativity, and adaptability. I continue exploring emerging fields such as aerospace, cyber-physical systems, and automation technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply passionate about lifelong learning. I actively seek out knowledge even in areas that might seem unrelated to my core expertise. I stay updated on the latest in technology by watching channels like Linus Tech Tips, Gamers Nexus, and JerryRigEverything, while also broadening my horizons with scientific insights from SmarterEveryday and Tyler Folse on nuclear technology and beyond. This wide-ranging curiosity fuels my creativity and keeps me at the forefront of emerging trends.
